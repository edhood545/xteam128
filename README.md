# Grocery Store Inventory Tracker
This project is a grocery store inventory tracker.  Entries are individual items (food) and all the associated metadata like order number, price, and expiration date.  This system must support file reading so that transactions that occurred and new orders can update the data.  The system should have a low complexity for search operations since current inventory will dictate future orders for the store.  Consequently, the main stakeholder for this product would be management at the grocery store.
